			<h1>Understanding Typhoons: <br>Definition, Causes, and Characteristics</h1>
			<p>Typhoons, sometimes referred to as hurricanes or tropical cyclones, are powerful tropical storms that develop in the western Pacific Ocean close to the equator. 
			<br>They can be identified by their strong, persistent winds that can reach 74 mph or more, heavy rainfall, 
			and storm surges that can badly damage property and endanger life.</p>
			
			<p>Typhoons are powered by warm ocean temperatures, and high humidity provides the moisture required for cloud formation and precipitation. 
			Its formation may be aided by atmospheric instability, which is brought on by the interaction of cold and warm air masses.
			</p>
			<p>Typhoons have a big effect on the environment, infrastructure, and lives of people. 
			Typhoons can have a variety of effects, such as:
			<br>1. <b>Damage to residences:</b> The typhoon can leave thousands of homes in the province destroyed or seriously damaged, making many citizens homeless or unable to live in their homes.
			<br>2. <b>Infrastructure damage:</b> The typhoon can seriously damage roads, bridges, and other forms of infrastructure, making it challenging for relief efforts to reach impacted areas.
			<br>3. <b>Economic Losses:</b> Typhoons can have serious economic effects, such as crop loss, infrastructure damage, and disruption of corporate operations, which can result in big monetary losses.
			<br>4. <b>Communication and power lines were damaged by the typhoon,</b> leaving many towns without access to energy or telephone service.
			<br>5. <b>Landslides and flooding:</b> Storms may trigger landslides and flooding in several regions, which led to a number of fatalities and injuries.

				<br><b>Vector-borne diseases</b> are illnesses that are transmitted to humans and animals through the bite of infected arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. Here are some examples of vector-borne diseases:<br>
				<br>1. <b>Malaria:</b> Malaria is a life-threatening disease that is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. It is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and can cause fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms.
